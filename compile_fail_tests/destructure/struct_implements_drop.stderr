error[E0509]: cannot move out of type `Wrap<T>`, which implements the `Drop` trait
  --> compile_fail_tests/destructure/struct_implements_drop.rs:13:9

   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |         |
   |         cannot move out of here
   |         data moved here
   |         move occurs because `value` has type `T`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__destructure__struct` which comes from the expansion of the macro `destructure` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
